## About
The main objective of this project was to practice econometric methods learned during classes. We've got 4 parts of the material and we had to perpare 3 models, each from different part. This repo is about second part named cross-sectional data and to be more specific, we estimated quantile regression for different quantiles and (Median too) and compared it to the OLS linear regression (expected value). This project is about house prices in 3 German Lands. Data was found on kaggle.com.
